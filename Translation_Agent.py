# Translation Agent - Agentic translation using reflection workflow

# https://github.com/andrewyng/translation-agent


"""
# Features:
This is a Python demonstration of a reflection agentic workflow for machine translation. The main steps are:

Prompt an LLM to translate a text from source_language to target_language.
Have the LLM reflect on the translation to come up with constructive suggestions for improving it.
Use the suggestions to improve the translation.


# Examples
This directory contains example scripts demonstrating the usage of the translation-agent workflow.

# Contents
example_script.py: A simple script showing how to perform machine translation using the package.
sample-texts/: A directory containing a few sample texts from The Batch letters written by Andrew and Data Points summaries found on the DeepLearning.ai website.

# Usage
To run the example scripts, ensure that you have installed the translation-agent package and have activated your virtual environment.

# Then run:

python example_script.py
