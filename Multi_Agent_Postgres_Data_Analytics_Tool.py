Setup:
Read the codebase first. Remember, this is an experiment and learning tool. It's not meant to be a framework or library.
Run git branch -a to view all branches. Each branch is a video in the series.
git checkout <branch-name> you want to view.
poetry install
cp .env.sample .env
Fill out .env with your postgres url and openai api key
Run a prompt against your database
poetry run start --prompt "<ask your agent a question about your postgres database>"
